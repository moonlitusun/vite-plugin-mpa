# Vite-plugin-mpa

## Description

This plugin provides true MPA functionality for Vite, eliminating various limitations of Vite MP.

**No matter where your entry files/template files are located, you can access pages through the root route, making it perfect for embedded page development.**

```plaintext
http://localhost:5173/index.html
http://localhost:5173/about.html
...
```

🙅🏻‍♀️: ~~No need to search everywhere for your MPA page addresses.~~

Try the [demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/2lrppj).
